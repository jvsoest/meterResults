# MeterResults

Basic python script to read DSMR 5.0 electric and gas meter, and store the result in a csv file ([test.py](test.py)). This can be executed on a local raspberry pi, e.g. using [this cable](https://www.sossolutions.nl/slimme-meter-kabel).

Including a script to run a Python+Flask+pandas web interface to see the current meter stats, and power consumption in the last 1/3/6/12/24/48 hours ([webService.py](webService.py]).
